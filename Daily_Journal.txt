The purpose of this journal is to keep track of my progress, troubles and thoughts
about the CCD analysis of the Optics Calibration data we took in NASA Marshall during
2017.

    * One of the first goals of this analysis is to extract the HPD from the CCD
      data we took at NASA Marshall.
    * All the progress is been reginstered in Jupyter Notebooks located in the folder
      Notebooks.
    * I began a test by creating a serie of Notebooks entitled: "HPD_test_**" where
      the ** refers to enumerate label I used to keep track of my progress in this
      respect.

    * The problem of this standard way to read the data is that is not clear how we
      can substract the dark-frames from the data since the name of the file is used
      as input for the AndorCCD functions.
    * Task: To find an easy way to substract the dark frames before plotting or
      processing the data.
